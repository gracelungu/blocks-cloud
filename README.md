### Decloud Smart Contracts

This project aims at providing an open-source decentralized cloud smart contract for cloud storage with the IPFS, to be integrated with open-source mobile and web applications.

### How it works

This project is made of 3 contracts:

- The cloud contract (Cloud)
- The private cloud contract (AddressCloud)
- The ownable contract (Ownable)

The cloud contract is responsible for creating and transferring the private cloud contract.
Once the private contract is created, the owner can add files under file types.

### Integration

These contracts can be integrated and have been integrated with the Decloud mobile application hosted here [decloud-mobile-expo](https://github.com/gracelungu/decloud-mobile-expo)

### Your contribution will be appreciated :)
